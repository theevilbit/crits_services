    You can run your CRITs-master on Django 1.7 with the latest commit!
    In order to run on 1.7 you'll have to add an one-liner to forms.py in your
    custom-made services.
    You'll need to add the following line:
        kwargs.setdefault('label_suffix', ':')
    before every occurrence of the following:
        super(YourCustomServiceConfigForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    in forms.py inside your custom-made services.

    The passivetotal_lookup service has been changed to use their new APIs.
    Please make sure you have "https://www.passivetotal.org/api/v1" in the
    service configuration for the query URL. Failure to do so will cause
    the service to break once the old APIs are removed.

    The relationship_service received an update which allows it to assign
    campaigns to nodes on the graph. Part of this change required an update
    to core CRITs code, so please make sure you update that too.
